\section*{Abstract}

The expression of genes in the human genome is not only based on the \ac{DNA} sequence; it relies on epigenetic modifications like \ac{DNA}-methylation. Thereby, gene expression is inactivated by the binding of a methyl-group to a \ac{CpG}-dinucleotide at the promoter region of the concerned gene.
