\section*{Abstract}

The expression of genes in the human genome is not only based on the DNA sequence; it relies on epigenetic modifications like DNA-methylations. Hereby, gene expression is inactivated by binding of methyl-groups to a \ac{CpG} dinucleotide at the promoter region of the concerned gene. The binding is performed by specific enzymes - the \ac{DNMTs}. The specific function of \ac{DNMTs} is not fully determined.\\
\\
In the following, the methylation of DNA is modelled using an \ac{MCMC} algorithm and parameters are estimated by \ac{MLE}. Alternatively, parameter estimation is performed with an implementation of the \ac{ABC} method. Moreover, a method to compare distributions of methylation patterns is provided.\\
We find differences in the function of the different \ac{DNMTs} that are consistent with current biological findings. Thus, using this model, some parameters are difficult to identify because they seem to be conditionally dependant.
