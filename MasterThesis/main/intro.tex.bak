\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

Today, more than 60 years after the initial mass-production of the first antibiotics, more and more pathogenic bacteria are developing resistance against major antibiotics. Especially problematic is the wide-spread bacterium \textit{\acf{S. aureus}} that can cause a large variety of illnesses ranging from skin infections over bloodstream infections to pneumonia \cite{levy2004, rubinstein2008, tong2015}. The severity of these infections can vary: some are relatively benign, others like necrotising fasciitis or necrotising pneumonia can be extremely lethal \cite{rubinstein2008, tong2015}. 
\par
\textit{S. aureus} was naturally susceptible to most classes of antibiotics and infections were therefore easily treatable \cite{chambers2009} at that time. However, over the last decades more and more antibiotic resistant \textit{S. aureus} strains have emerged that make treatment more difficult. The most notorious are \ac{MRSA} strains that are resistant to \textbeta-lactam antibiotics and are often multidrug resistant. At first, MRSA infections were limited to health care settings, but now there are more and more community-associated strains that are particularly virulent \cite{chua2001, chambers2001, chambers2009, davies2010}. The prevalence of MRSA has been increasing over the past decades to the point that in the European Union alone there are annually more than 150,000 patients in hospitals suffering from MRSA infections \cite{koeck2010}. 
\par
As a result, the antibiotic resistance of \textit{S. aureus} has been extensively studied and a large number of genes that confer resistance to various antibiotics was discovered \cite{jensen2009, costa2013}. Some of these genes code for enzymes like \textbeta-lactamase that render certain antibiotics dysfunctional, for instance by degrading the active site, or are themselves a target of antibiotics. Other genes code for efflux transporters that can extrude antibiotics from the bacterial cell \cite{lyon1987, webber2003, levy2004, sun2014}.
\par
It has been shown that mutations in these antibiotic resistance genes can have an impact on the antibiotic resistance of the strain. For instance, mutations in an antibiotic’s target protein can prevent the antibiotic from interacting with that target and thus mitigate the antibiotic’s effect \cite{ito1994, yamagishi1996, fujimoto2005}.  Additionally, mutations in genes coding for regulators of these antibiotic resistance genes can also impact antibiotic resistance by up- or downregulating their expression \cite{grkovic2001, kaatz2005a, kaatz2005b}.
\par
Traditionally, mutations causing or impacting antibiotic resistance are found and studied experimentally \cite{ito1994, yamagishi1996, fujimoto2005}. For example, antibiotics are used to isolate resistant mutants whose genomes are then sequenced and compared to a reference genome to find mutations that could be responsible for the antibiotic resistance. Transformation with mutated and wild-type plasmids can then be used to test the impact of the mutations \cite{ito1994, yamagishi1996, fujimoto2005}.
\par
The goal of this thesis was to computationally investigate mutations and their potential impact on antibiotic resistance. For that purpose a program was designed that given mutation information automatically analyses the possible effect of these mutations in various gene regions, such as transcription factor binding sites or coding regions. Mutations in transcription factor binding sites were evaluated using position weight matrices, whereas mutations in protein coding regions were scored with an amino acid substitution matrix. In addition, their possible location in protein domains was considered. The results were statistically compared between known antibiotic resistance genes and non-antibiotic resistance genes. Furthermore, the gene regulatory network of the organism was built to examine the potential global effect of the individual mutations. The program was then applied to \textit{S. aureus} to estimate the impact of selected mutations on its antibiotic resistance.
\par
The next chapter gives a brief explanation of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance mechanisms, as well as genes, proteins, gene regulation and mutations. Additionally, it introduces more background information on \textit{S. aureus} and its pathology. Chapter \ref{chapter:materials} lists and describes the data sets used to analyse \textit{S. aureus}. Subsequently, Chapter \ref{chapter:methods} explains the methodology of the different analysis steps and the developed program, along with its implementation. The results of mutation analysis in \textit{S. aureus} are presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:results} and are then interpreted and discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:discussion}. Lastly, Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusion} draws conclusions about the effectiveness of the methodology and the mutations in \textit{S. aureus}, and gives a brief outlook.
