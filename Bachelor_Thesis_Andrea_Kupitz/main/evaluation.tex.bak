\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{chapter:rd}

In this thesis, a command-line tool was designed that automatically performs multiple analysis steps on a bacterial genome and a set of mutations to estimate the impact of the mutations on the antibiotic resistance of the bacterium. The tool was then applied to the \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} strain NCTC 8325 to investigate the potential effect of mutations on its antibiotic resistance.
\par
Chapter \ref{chapter:background} gave background information on antibiotic resistance mechanisms, with an emphasis on the role of multidrug resistance efflux pumps, and explained the potential impact of mutations on antibiotic resistance depending on their location in coding regions, promoter regions and transcription factor binding sites. It further introduced \textit{S. aureus} and the challenges antibiotic resistant strains pose for health systems all around the world. The data sets used in this thesis to analyse \textit{S. aureus}, such as the NCTC 8325 genome, information on antibiotic resistance genes, gene regulation, transcription factor binding sites, protein domains and mutations, were described in Chapter \ref{chapter:materials}. Chapter \ref{chapter:methods} outlined the methodology as well as the implementation of the command-line tool.
\par
After preprocessing the data sets to build a unified database (Section \ref{section:APP_methods}), the mutation density and mutation distributions in antibiotic resistance and non-antibiotic resistance genes were analysed and statistically compared by the tool (Section \ref{section:SMDG_methods} and Section \ref{section:MS_methods}). Furthermore, the PAM10 amino acid substitution matrix \cite{dayhoff1978} was used to score mutations in coding regions (Section \ref{section:C_methods}), and a position weight matrix based score for mutations in transcription factor binding sites was computed (Section \ref{section:TFBS_methods}). Lastly, the gene regulatory network was built to investigate the global impact of mutations (Section \ref{section:GRN_methods}). Figure \ref{figure:flowchart} presents an overview of the program flow. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test \cite{wilcoxon1945} was used to conduct statistical comparisons between mutations in antibiotic resistance and mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes.
\par
This chapter first presents and discusses the results of applying the tool to mutations in the \textit{S. aureus} strain NCTC 8325 in order to analyse their effect on its antibiotic resistance. For coding region mutations, the mutations are labelled by their reference and alternative amino acid and their 1-based position in the amino acid sequence, e.g. pV132I describes a coding region mutation at position 132 where valine is replaced by isoleucine. Similarly, mutations in the DNA sequence are referred to by their reference and alternative DNA base and their 1-based positions in the DNA sequence, e.g. gA13T describes a substitution of adenine by thymine at position 13 in the DNA sequence. Due to the large number of mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, only non-synonymous, promoter and transcription factor binding site mutations with enough supporting information to make an educated guess are discussed. The limitations of this thesis are addressed at the end of this chapter.

\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

\mypar{Overview} In total, 19221 mutations in 2976 genes were analysed, whereby 390 mutations were located in 47 antibiotic resistance associated genes, including MDR efflux pumps and direct MDR efflux pump regulators. There were only 3 transcription factor binding sites in antibiotic resistance genes, and only 1 of these binding sites contained a mutation. Furthermore, there was only 1 nonsense, 1 readthrough and 1 reading-frame shift mutations in antibiotic resistance genes. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test requires a sample size > 20 in order to be valid, so that for these instances no statistically valid comparison could be made between mutations in antibiotic resistance and mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes.
\par
Table \ref{table:gene_stats} gives an overview of the number of genes, differentiated by their role in antibiotic resistance, and the number of transcription factor binding sites and transcription factors. Table \ref{table:mutations_stats} presents the number of mutations in coding regions, promoter regions and transcription factor binding sites.

\mypar{Mutation Distribution}
\label{distribution}
The percentage of transitions, transversions and indels (Figure \ref{figure:mutation_type}), as well as the percentage of synonymous and non-synonymous, promoter and transcription factor binding site mutations (Figure \ref{figure:distribution}) was statistically compared between the 390 mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, including MDR efflux pumps and direct MDR efflux pump regulators, and the 18861 mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes (see Section \ref{section:MS_methods}). 
\par
There was no significant difference between the percentage of transversions (31.8\%), transitions ($\sim$67\%) and indels ($\sim$1\%) in antibiotic resistance and non-antibiotic resistance genes. The same was true for synonymous, nonsense, readthrough, reading-frame shift, promoter and transcription factor binding site mutations. However, the percentage of synonymous (63.3\% vs. 69.0\%) and promoter mutations (7.2\% vs. 9.5\%) was higher in antibiotic resistance genes, while the percentage of missense mutations was significantly lower in antibiotic resistance genes (28.4\% vs. 20.8\%, p-value 0.0095).
\par
This was to be expected, as antibiotic resistance genes are important for the survival of the strain and MDR efflux pumps not only extrude antibiotics but also other substances \cite{}. While some missense mutations might prove beneficial for the strain by changing the antibiotic target in such a way that renders the antibiotic ineffective, missense mutations in key protein domains of antibiotic resistance genes or MDR efflux pumps that disrupt the protein function could decrease the strain's antibiotic resistance and survival rate and thus be overall selected against. Synonymous mutations on the other hand do not pose the same danger as they do not change the amino acid sequence. Combined this would lead to a higher percentage of synonymous mutations and lower percentage of missense mutations in antibiotic resistance genes than in non-antibiotic resistance genes, as was observed here.
\par
Nonsense, readthrough and frame-shift mutations can not just affecting a single amino acid but larger parts of the amino acid sequence, which could be very disruptive in non-antibiotic resistance genes as well and might explain their low frequency in both antibiotic resistance and non-antibiotic resistance genes. Due to the lack of promoter region information and corresponding gene expression data, it is impossible to estimate how the promoter mutations would affect gene regulation and gene expression, and with that to give a n explanation why the frequency of promoter region mutations is higher in antibiotic resistance genes. Since the difference is not significant, it might be by chance as well.

\mypar{Mutation Density} 
The mutations were divided based on their location in coding regions, promoter regions and transcription factor binding sites and further based on their effect on the amino acid sequence in the coding region. The mutation density in these different categories was then statistically compared between antibiotic resistance genes, including MDR efflux pumps and direct MDR efflux pump regulators, and non-antibiotic resistance genes (see Figure \ref{figure:density} for the boxplot, Section \ref{section:SMDG_methods} for the methodology).  
\par
The mutation density of synonymous mutations is significantly higher in antibiotic resistance genes than non-antibiotic resistance genes (p-value 0.011). There was no significant difference between antibiotic resistance and non-antibiotic resistance genes for non-synonymous mutations and mutations in promoter regions or transcription factor binding sites.  However, the mean mutation density for missense mutations was higher in non-antibiotic resistance genes (2.5 vs. 1.6 mutations/kbp). Additionally,  the MDR efflux pump \textit{norC} and the antibiotic resistance genes \textit{SAOUHSC\_02826}, \textit{lmrB3} and \textit{malR} were outliers with regard to the mutation density in the promoter region (see Figure \ref{figure:promoter}).  This pattern is consistent with the distribution of different mutation types described and discussed in \ref{distribution}.

\mypar{Mutations in Coding Regions}
To estimate the impact of mutations in coding regions on antibiotic resistance, the amino acid substitution matrix PAM10 was used to compute a normalised score for missense, nonsense, readthrough and reading-frame shift mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, including MDR efflux pumps and direct MDR efflux pump regulators, and non-antibiotic resistance genes (see Figure \ref{figure:coding} for the boxplot, Section \ref{section:C_methods} for the methodology). A score of 1 indicates that the reference and mutated amino acid sequences are identical, whereas a score of 0 indicates that the mutated sequence differs as much as possible from the reference sequence.
\par
There was no significant difference between the scores of mutations in antibiotic resistance genes and mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes. The scores of missense mutations had a rounded mean of 1 in both types of genes, indicating that they made little difference in the context of the entire amino acid sequence. In the case of nonsense mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes, the mean was 0.6 with scores ranging from 1 to nearly 0. This indicates that they can occur everywhere from the beginning of the amino acid sequence, thus shortening the protein substantially, to the end of sequence, but are on average located near the middle of the protein. There was only a single nonsense mutation in antibiotic resistance genes (\textit{norG} to be precise, see \ref{norG}). The same is true for readthrough and reading-frame shift mutations.
\par
Similar to missense mutations, the rounded mean score of readthrough mutations is 1 in both antibiotic resistance and non-antibiotic resistance genes, with all scores distributed close to 1. This suggests that the substitution of the stop codon by an amino acid does not increase the protein length by much. The mean score of reading-frame shift mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes is 0.5, with scores ranging from 1 to nearly 0, indicating that some reading-frame shift mutations change the amino acid sequence almost completely, while others change almost nothing. The single reading-frame shift mutation in antibiotic resistance genes 

\par
The low number of nonsense, readthrough and reading-frame shift mutations in antibiotic resistance genes is explained by the comparatively small number of total mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, as they occur at the same frequency as nonsense, readthrough and reading-frame shift mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes (see \ref{distribution}). It makes a statistically valid comparison of scores between such mutations in antibiotic resistance genes and non-antibiotic resistance genes impossible.

\mypar{Mutations in Transcription Factor Binding Sites}
For every transcription factor binding site, the position weight matrix of the corresponding transcription factor was computed, which was then used to calculate a score for the reference binding site sequence, the observed mutated sequence and randomly generated mutated sequences. To investigate if the observed mutations increase or decrease the ability of the transcription factor to bind, and if there is a difference between observed and randomly generated mutations, the differences between the reference score and the observed mutation scores, and the difference between the reference score and the random mutation scores were compared in antibiotic resistance genes, including MDR efflux pumps and direct MDR efflux pump regulators, and non-antibiotic resistance genes (see Figure \ref{figure:tfbs} for the boxplot, Section \ref{section:TFBS_methods} for the methodology). 
\par
In non-antibiotic resistance genes there was no significant difference between the scores of the 37 observed mutations (mean 0.02) in transcription factor binding sites and the 555 randomly generated mutations (mean 0.03). For both observed and randomly generated mutations, 75\% of the scores are $> 0$.  In antibiotic resistance genes there was a significant difference (p-value 0.0018) between the score of the single observed mutation (mean -0.01) in the binding site of the transcription factor \textit{lexA} in the promoter region of the operon of antibiotic resistance genes \textit{parC} and \textit{parE}, and the score of the 15 randomly generated mutations (mean 0.01) in the same binding site. Similarly to non-antibiotic resistance genes, the 75\% of the randomly generated mutations had a score $> 0$, whereas the score of the single observed mutation was $< 0$. Furthermore, the score of the single observed mutation in a transcription factor binding site in antibiotic resistance genes differed significantly (p-value 0.00000062) from the 37 observed transcription factor binding site mutations in non-antibiotic resistance genes.

\mypar{Gene Regulatory Network}
To examine the global effect of mutations on the antibiotic resistance, the gene regulatory network was built (Section \ref{section:GRN_methods}). Figure \ref{figure:grn} presents the antibiotic resistance subnetwork of the gene regulatory network with the number of non-synonymous, promoter and transcription factor binding site mutations in each gene. The MDR efflux pump \textit{sepA} and the antibiotic resistance genes \textit{rpoB}, \textit{tuf}, \textit{msbA}, \textit{fmtC}, \textit{uppP}, \textit{slyA}, \textit{ileS}, \textit{pbp2}, \textit{pbp4}, \textit{lmrB2}, \textit{lmrB3}, \textit{fosB}, \textit{vga}, \textit{SAOUHSC\_02797}, \textit{malrR}, \textit{sirR}, \textit{folP}, \textit{dfrA}, \textit{marR}, \textit{SAOUHSC\_02826}, and \textit{SAOUHSC\_02629} are not shown as there was no information on their regulation available. The MDR efflux pump \textit{mepA} was only shown to be repressed by the regulator \textit{mepR}. All other antibiotic resistance genes, MDR efflux pumps and their direct regulators were part of a tightly regulated subnetwork.
\par
The following paragraphs discuss individual antibiotic resistance genes, MDR efflux pumps and their regulators with regard to their role in the gene regulatory network and the potential impact of their mutations.

hydrophobic \textbeta-lactams, abc pump

\mypar{\textit{arlS} and (truncated-) \textit{arlR}}
The global regulator \textit{arlS} is part of a two-component regulatory system with \textit{arlR} that regulates the MFS MDR efflux pumps \textit{norA} and \textit{norB} \cite{fournier2000}. It contained the missense mutation pA216T (score 0.999) in the HAMP (histidine kinases, adenly cyclases, methyl-accepting proteins and phosphatases) linker domain, which can accompany DNA binding domains in prokaryotic signalling proteins \cite{hamp}. However, the UniprotKB protein domain data set did not contain information on such a DNA binding domain, so that is impossible to say if the mutation affects the regulation of \textit{norA} or \textit{norB} and with that quinolone resistance. The truncated \textit{arlR} did not contain mutations.

\mypar{\textit{fur}}
The iron-dependent, \textit{norA} activating regulator \textit{fur} contained 2 missense mutations (pV139M and pP115S, scores 0.9974 and 0.9974) as well, but they were not associated with protein domains. It is therefore not clear if they could impact the activation of \textit{norA} and consequently quinolone resistance.  

\mypar{\textit{gyrA}}
\label{gyrA}
The DNA gyrase subunit A gene \textit{gyrA}  confers resistance to (fluoro-) quinolones (Table \ref{table:antibiotic_source}). It is part of an operon with the DNA gyrase subunit B gene \textit{gyrB} that is regulated by \textit{sarA} (Figure \ref{figure:grn}). \textit{GyrA} contained a promoter mutation and 3 missense mutations pS84L, pA457T and pL501F with scores 0.9993, 0.9996 and 0.9996 respectively. The pS84L mutation was flagged as causing resistance to fluoroquinolones in the UniProtKB data set. The UniProtKB data set further contained the fluoroquinolone resistance mutations pS84A and pE88K. 

\mypar{\textit{lmrB2} and \textit{lmrB3}}
There was no information on MFS MDR efflux pumps \textit{lmrB2} and \textit{lmrB3} ((Table \ref{table:mdr_source}) regulation. However, \textit{lmrB2} contained the 3 missense mutations pV337I, pN300K and pF132L (scores 0.9994, 0.9991, 0.999) in the MFS domain, whereby pV337I and pN300K were additionally located in a transmembrane helix. Similarly, \textit{lmrB3} contained the 4 missense mutations pA255V, pL237I, pL179V and pI178L (scores 0.9992, 0.9993, 0.9992, 0.9991) also in the MFS domain, with the latter 3 mutations occurring in a transmembrane helix as well. These mutations could interfere with the transport function of the pumps and thus reduce antibiotic resistance.

\mypar{\textit{mepA} and \textit{mepR}}
The MATE MDR efflux pump \textit{mepA} is repressed by the regulator \textit{mepR} and confers resistance to tigercycline (Table \ref{table:mdr_source}, Figure \ref{figure:grn}). \textit{MepR} contained no non-synonymous, promoter or transcription factor binding site mutations that could impact the expression of \textit{mepA}. \textit{MepA} on the other hand  contained the 4 missense mutations pV167I, pI214V, pS332I and pA364T with amino acid substitution scores 0.9994, 0.9993, 0.9988 and 0.9993 respectively.  The mutations pI214V, pS332I and pA364T were located in transmembrane helices and could impact the % TODO

\mypar{\textit{mgrA}}
The global regulator \textit{mgrA} represses the MDR efflux pumps \textit{norA}, \textit{norB}, \textit{norC} as well as \textit{tet38}, and activates the MDR efflux pump \textit{abcA}, the teicoplanin resistance conferring gene \textit{tcaR} and the global regulator \textit{sarZ} (Figure \ref{figure:grn}). It contained no non-synonymous, promoter or transcription factor binding site mutations that could affect the expression of the regulated antibiotic resistance and MDR efflux pump genes.

\mypar{\textit{msrA} and \textit{msrB}}
The ABC MDR efflux pump \textit{msrA} occurs at 3 different loci in the NCTC 8325 genome, one of which is part of an operon with the ABC MDR efflux pump \textit{msrB}. They confer resistance to macrolides, streptogramin B and telithromycin. \textit{MsrA} and the \textit{msrA}-\textit{msrB} operon are activated by the global regulator \textit{rot} (Table \ref{table:mdr_source}, Figure \ref{figure:grn}). \textit{MsrB} contained a pL84V missense mutation with a score of 0.9973 located in the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase (MsrB) domain that could interfere with its function. The \textit{msrA} locus \textit{SAOUHSC\_01360} contained the missense mutation pP133L (score 0.9966), \textit{SAOUHSC\_01432} the missense mutations pQ50K and pE44K (scores 0.9973, 0.9973) and \textit{SAOUHSC\_02996} the missense mutations pQ86E, pQ79R and pA2V (scores 0.998, 0.9974, 0.9976). The pQ86E and pQ79R mutations occurred in the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (PMSR) domain and could effect its function. The other mutations were not located in a protein domain and it is not clear if and how they would impact antibiotic resistance. % FIX

\mypar{\textit{norA}}
The MFS MDR efflux pump \textit{norA} confers resistance to (fluoro-) quinolones and is repressed by \textit{mgrA}, affected by \textit{arlS} and activated by \textit{fur} (Table \ref{table:mdr_source}, Figure \ref{figure:grn}). It contained the missense mutation pG101S (score 0.9991) in the MFS domain and transmembrane helix, and the missense mutation pD291G (score 0.9988) also in the MFS domain. These mutations could reduce antibiotic resistance by interfering with the transport function. 


\mypar{\textit{norB}}
Like \textit{norA}, the MFS MDR efflux pump \textit{norB} confers resistance to (fluoro-) quinolones and is activated by \textit{norG}, repressed by \textit{mgrA} and \textit{sarZ}, and affected by \textit{arlS}, all of which are global regulators. \textit{NorB} contained the missense mutations pF358L and pS215T (scores 0.999, 0.9994) in transmembrane helices, as well as 2 promoter mutations. % TODO 


\mypar{\textit{norC}}
\textit{NorC} is a MFS MDR efflux pump that is repressed by the global regulators \textit{norG} and \textit{mgrA}, and confers resistance to (fluoro-) quinolones. It contained the 3 missense mutations pT42A, pF278V and pA417V (scores 0.9992, 0.9985, 0.9992) in the MFS domain. The mutations pF278V and pA417V were additionally located in transmembrane helices. These mutations could affect the transport function of the pump in a way that reduces antibiotic resistance. \textit{NorC} also contained 4 promoter mutations, however, it is impossible to estimate their impact on the expression of \textit{norC} due to missing promoter region information.


\mypar{\textit{norG}}
The global regulator \textit{norG} plays a key role in the MDR efflux regulation. It represses the MDR efflux pumps \textit{abcA} and \textit{norC}, and activates the MDR efflux pump \textit{norB} and the regulators \textit{mgrA}, \textit{lexA}, \textit{arlS}, \textit{sarR} and \textit{sarZ} (Figure \ref{figure:grn}). \textit{NorG} includes a DNA binding HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain at the beginning of the gene that contained 2 missense mutations (pS28P and pH29Q, scores 0.9992 and 0.9992) and a nonsense mutations (pK5Stop, score 0.0088). The nonsense mutation would result in an amino acid sequence of length 4 that could not

\section{Limitations}
First, the size and extensiveness of the input data sets is critically important for the statistical validity and ability to make  biologically meaningful estimations of the impact of individual mutations on antibiotic resistance. In particular, the lack of promoter information made an analysis of promoter mutations in \textit{S. aureus} NCTC 8325 impossible, and the small number of transcription factor binding sites in antibiotic resistance genes posed a similar problem. Similarly, the lack of corresponding gene expression data only allowed to make guesses about the effect of mutations in regulators on the expression of antibiotic resistance genes. Furthermore,  the tool only evaluates single mutations and does not consider the cumulative impact of multiple mutations. The tool output therefore only enables a rough estimation of the effect of mutation on antibiotic resistance and cannot replace experimental validation.
\par
Lastly, the normalised amino acid substitution score is based on the entire amino acid sequence, which is advantageous for nonsense, readthrough and reading-frame shift mutations that can potentially affect the entire amino acid sequence. It further allows to compare the scores of nonsense, readthrough, reading-frame shift and missense mutations with regard to the similarity of the reference and mutated protein. On the other hand, it results in very high scores (close to the maximum of 1.0) for missense mutations that would indicate that they have a small impact on the amino acid sequence, even though some of them have been shown to affect the antibiotic resistance, like the \textit{gyrA} (\ref{gyrA}) mutations that are associated with fluoroqunolone resistance.
